He felt that this would make audiences relax and realize that he wasn't someone who would take advantage of a vulnerable young girl. Reno claims that for Léon, the possibility of a physical relationship with Mathilda is not even conceivable, and as such, during the scenes when such a relationship is discussed, Reno very much allowed Portman to be emotionally in control of the scenes. ","Many viewers believe that Stansfield never saw Leon, and therefore could not recognize him at the end, but may not remember that Stansfield visited Tony at the restaurant after Leon had killed part of Stansfield's crew. Thus, being intimidated and threatened by Stansfield, it could be assumed that Tony gave him a complete description of Leon, and possibly a photograph. ","  Mathilda  : I don't wanna lose you, Leon.    Léon  : You're not going to lose me. You've given me a taste for life. I wanna be happy. Sleep in a bed, have roots. And you'll never be alone again, Mathilda. Please, go now, baby, go. Calm down, I'll meet you at Tony's in an hour, I love you, now go, go now.  ","Under the 'SPECIAL THANKS' heading you will find:

He had trained so hard that he was able to catch up to  Edward Furlong  on his dirt bike with ease. ","If the T-1000 can mimic any person or form it touches, there is no logical reason why it keeps reverting back into the form of Robert Patrick dressed as a cop once the Connors are aware of this guise. It could achieve its mission objective far easier if it used other forms to conceal its identity and then kill the Connors before they even realized.
POSSIBLE EXPLANATION: It is probable that the T-1000 knew that a uniformed police officer would be the form of human most likely to be let alone and permitted to go anywhere he pleased without being questioned or otherwise hindered, especially at security checkpoints like the prison's gate and front desk. And indeed, he is always just waved on through or buzzed in without question at these spots. ","  The Terminator  : Hasta la vista, baby.

editing done electronically at the time was horrible because all the good
editors were still working on film (which is much more difficult). Because
of this he thought about putting 'Edited on a piece of s*** Steenbeck' at
the end of the credits, but instead settled for the more subtle line
'Edited on film.' Tim Robbins was directing 'Dead Man Walking' at the time
and heard about John's idea, which sparked that film's credit ending of
'This film was edited on old machines.' ","The Australian television version left the line-up scene unedited for language.

Hitchcock later said, 'Thirty-three percent of the effect of Psycho was due to the music.' Ironically, he was originally adamant that there should be no music in the shower scene but he was persuaded by his wife to give it a try. The screeching violins and dire strings (which would inspire the music for  Lo squalo (1975)  ) ending up selling the scene and driving theatrical audiences beyond anything they had ever experienced. ","When Lila approaches Mother in the fruit cellar, Mrs. Bates is seated in a four-legged chair. After Lila touches the corpse, it slowly spins around as if it's sitting on a swiveling chair. The effect was achieved by a prop man lying on his back rotating a camera head with wheels underneath Mother. ","  [last lines]     Norma Bates  :  [voiceover in police custody, as Norman is thinking]  It's sad, when a mother has to speak the words that condemn her own son. But I couldn't allow them to believe that I would commit murder. They'll put him away now, as I should have years ago. He was always bad, and in the end he intended to tell them I killed those girls and that man... as if I could do anything but just sit and stare, like one of his stuffed birds. They know I can't move a finger, and I won't. I'll just sit here and be quiet, just in case they do... suspect me. They're probably watching me. Well, let them. Let them see what kind of a person I am. I'm not even going to swat that fly. I hope they are watching... they'll see. They'll see and they'll know, and they'll say, 'Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly...'

The following changes were made to the film for this release:
-This movie opens with 'The Lion King: Special Edition' title card, following the Walt Disney Pictures logo(mistakenly orange and black instead of blue).
-The pouncing lesson scene was replaced with an all-new song, 'Morning Report', originally from the stage show.
-The animation of crocodiles in the 'I Just Can't Wait to be King' sequence was completely re-done.
-The animation in some of the scenes went back through the clean-up animation department a second time, to correct problems such as wavering lines and missing details, which, while not very noticeable during a traditional 35mm showing of the film, would have been discomforting on a much large IMAX screen. Small details, such as the characters who had faces that were too small to be seen in the original had faces, were also added.
-The waterfalls in the 'Can You Feel The Love Tonight' sequence were enhanced.
-The 2002 IMAX and 2003 Platinum Edition releases contains the static TV airing end credits.

Leone replied, 'Picture this: the camera shows a gunman from the waist down pulling his gun and shooting a running child. The camera pans up to the gunman's face and...it's Henry Fonda' (until then, with one exception, Fonda had only been cast in 'good guy' roles. Leone wanted the audience to be shocked). ","Frank goes to Morton's train and finds that dead bodies are scattered around. But the train's fireman appears not to be bothered. The engine's safety valve opens frequently, which means that the fireman dutifully keeps doing his job and keeps the boiler at maximum pressure.

The Italian translates to 'play something for your brother,' but the most common English version is 'keep your loving brother happy,' and the German translates to 'play me the song of death.'

Robinson lived as Chung, never breaking character while in public. He died in March 1918, when a bullet-catch trick went wrong. 'My God, I've been shot' were both his last words and the first English he had spoken on stage in nineteen years. ","When Angier visits Tesla in February, it is obviously winter, with snow on the ground. Yet after a brief meeting they venture out to a balcony, where it is summer, with green foliage, and no breath visible. ","  Cutter  : Every great magic trick consists of three parts or acts. The first part is called 'The Pledge'. The magician shows you something ordinary: a deck of cards, a bird or a man. He shows you this object. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it to see if it is indeed real, unaltered, normal. But of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called 'The Turn'. The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it, because of course you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled. But you wouldn't clap yet. Because making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call 'The Prestige'.'

He also did not sleep for a few days, in order to achieve his character's disoriented look. ","When the detectives are at the door of John Doe's apartment, John walks into the hallway. He sees them, drops his bag of groceries, pulls a gun, shoots, and runs. The bag is now on the floor, with its contents spilled out. When Mills gives chase, he runs down the same hallway. The dropped bag of groceries has vanished. ","  David Mills  : Wait, I thought all you did was kill innocent people.    John Doe  : Innocent? Is that supposed to be funny? An obese man... a disgusting man who could barely stand up; a man who if you saw him on the street, you'd point him out to your friends so that they could join you in mocking him; a man, who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish your meal. After him, I picked the lawyer and I know you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one. This is a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath that he could muster to keeping murderers and rapists on the streets!    David Mills  : Murderers?    John Doe  : A woman...    David Mills  : Murderers, John, like yourself?    John Doe  :  [interrupts]  A woman... so ugly on the inside she couldn't bear to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside. A drug dealer, a drug dealing pederast, actually! And let's not forget the disease-spreading whore! Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face. But that's the point. We see a deadly sin on every street corner, in every home, and we tolerate it. We tolerate it because it's common, it's trivial. We tolerate it morning, noon, and night. Well, not anymore. I'm setting the example. What I've done is going to be puzzled over and studied and followed... forever.  ","SPOILER:  Kevin Spacey  's name is not included in the opening titles to keep the John Doe intrigue going. To compensate, he is listed twice in the closing credits: once before the credits start rolling and once in the rolling credits in order of appearance. ","USA laserdisc edition adds a few scenes deleted from theatrical release as a bonus at the end of the program, including: a prologue where Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is going to buy a country house. He uses his switchblade (seen many times in the final cut, but not explained) to cut out a small piece of wallpaper. There is an extended scene at the Mills' when David (Brad Pitt) is playing with his dogs, and Somerset talks to Tracy. He tells her about the house and shows her the wallpaper. She tells him that it wouldn't be such a good idea to show it to David, saying 'He wouldn't understand.'. These two scenes establish Somerset's characters better, and the second one helps the viewer understand why the wife chooses Somerset to talk to when she gets pregnant. She knows that Somerset is much more sensible than her husband, and will understand her. The second one however was probably dumped earlier since it is included among the dailies and outtakes and the first one appears as a deleted scene.

Palahniuk concluded that the reason people reacted this way was because if they asked him what had happened, a degree of personal interaction would be necessary, and his workmates simply didn't care enough to connect with him on a personal level. It was his fascination with this societal 'blocking' which became the foundation for the novel.

Franklin  and his team at Double Negative. Thorne provided pages of deeply sourced theoretical equations to the team, which then created new CGI software programs based on these equations to create accurate computer simulations of these phenomena. Some individual frames took up to one hundred hours to render, and ultimately the whole CGI program reached to eight hundred terabytes of data. The resulting visual effects provided Thorne with new insight into the effects of gravitational lensing and accretion disks surrounding black holes, and led to him writing two scientific papers, one for the astrophysics community, and one for the computer graphics community. ","Two characters sustain a fall from an ice plateau, on a steep ice ramp, onto a shadowy ice platform. A moment later, a panoramic shot shows them fighting on a very different place.

","The Warner Bros, Paramount, Syncopy and Legendary Pictures logos are brown and dusty, representing Earth's arid dry state in the film. ","The 70mm IMAX version is two minutes shorter than the regular 70mm, Digital IMAX, 35mm, and digital projection versions. This is because the end credits are played in an abbreviated slide-show form (rather than scrolling from bottom to top), due to the size capacity of the IMAX platters, which can hold a maximum of 167 minutes of film.

Despite a good deal of research, he did not feel he had enough solid factual information to make the movie. He then pitched the idea of a film that would cover a series of five samurai battles, based on the lives of famous Japanese swordsmen. Hashimoto went off to write that script, but Kurosawa ultimately scrapped that idea as well, worrying that a film that was just 'a series of climaxes' wouldn't work. Then, producer  Sôjirô Motoki  found, through historical research, that samurai in the 'Warring States' period of Japanese history would often volunteer to stand guard at peasant villages overnight in exchange for food and lodging. Kurosawa then came across an anecdote about a village hiring samurai to protect them and decided to use that idea. Kurosawa wrote a complete dossier for each character with a speaking role. In it were details about what they wore, their favourite foods, their past history, their speaking habits, their reaction to battle and every other detail he could think of about them. No other Japanese director had ever done this before. ","In the closing moments of the final battle, the bandits fire two musket shots only seconds apart. It is clear from the plot that at that point they possess only one musket. The black powder muskets of the age required much more time to reload. This error was pointed out in the commentary of the deluxe DVD edition. ","  Kambei Shimada  : This is the nature of war: By protecting others, you save yourselves.

There were so many extras that they would often recognize each other other extras in New Zealand's main cities, by wearing the shirts. On the front of the shirt was the statement 'I Survived Helm's Deep', with the letter M is struck out, indicating 'hell' of the experience. Two versions existed. One was in black, with red printing on the back that read 'Lord of the Rings
Uruk-Hai Battalion', The other was in blue with silver printing on the back that read 'The Lord of the Rings 'Elf Regiment'. ","The face-off between Frodo and the winged Nazgûl is a serious plot hole in the film. The whole point of the quest of the Fellowship was to leave Sauron in doubt about the whereabouts of the Ring, and to distract him from it and its location as it is carried closer to Mordor. That was the only chance for the quest to succeed. As far as he knows the Ring is missing somewhere in the region of the Shire, and nothing leads him to believe otherwise. But putting Frodo directly in front of a Nazgûl in Osgiliath, about to put the Ring on, would alert Sauron to the fact that the Ring not only has been found, but it's in Gondor and is perilously close to his borders. He would have immediately thrown the full weight of all his armies on Gondor to reclaim the Ring and the war would have been lost. ","  Frodo  : I can't do this, Sam.    Sam  : I know. It's all wrong. By rights we shouldn't even be here. But we are. It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger, they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't. They kept going. Because they were holding on to something.    Frodo  : What are we holding onto, Sam?

A longer scene of Vincent Vega purchasing heroin at Lance (Eric Stoltz)'s house, complaining about how rude people are.

Another additional scene takes place in Esmarelda's cab, where Butch does a lengthier explanation of how he feels about killing the man in the boxing ring. The other scene included on this DVD takes place at the auto parts yard, where Winston Wolf and the yard owner's daughter flirt and make plans for breakfast.

Hayao Miyazaki's films never had scripts during their production. 'I don't have the story finished and ready when we start work on a film,' the filmmaker told Midnight Eye. 'I usually don't have the time. So, the story develops when I start drawing storyboards. The production starts soon while the storyboards are still developing.' Miyazaki does not know where the plot is going, and he lets it happen organically. 'It's not me who makes the film. The film makes itself, and I have no choice but to follow.' ","After Haku flies out of the bedroom we see Sen's left hand touching more of the blood on the railing. The elevator attendant sees it on the same hand
after grabbing her arm as she tries to board it. Not much later we see her looking at the same hand again before running across the pipe.
It isn't till after being held captive by the baby under the cushions that the blood switches hands as he holds her by the left arm revealing no blood on that hand at all. ","  Zeniba  : Once you do something, you never forget. Even if you can't remember.  ","The credits have a series of still images from the film. The last image
before the film fades is Chihiro's shoe in the river. ","Various dialog is added to the English dub to explain settings, translate Japanese text, or traditions; for example, when Chihiro first sees the bathhouse, in the English dub, she says 'It's a bathhouse', which isn't present in the Japanese version.

He could be funny and make you laugh. Heath's gone in a completely different direction to Jack, he's like a really scary psychopath. He's a lovely guy and his Joker is going to be a hell of a revelation in this picture.' Caine bases this belief on a scene where The Joker pays a visit to Bruce Wayne's penthouse. He'd never met Ledger before, so when Ledger arrived and performed, he gave Caine such a fright, he forgot his lines. ","It is said that all of the license plates seen on cars in the film are Illinois plates. In fact, they're not: they are actually plates for the fictional Gotham, although they resemble Illinois plates. The 'Gotham' plates that were created by film makers were made to look like Illinois plates, just in case some slipped through in background shots during filming in Chicago. ","  The Chechen  :  [During a private sit down meeting with the gangsters]  What do you propose?    The Joker  : It's simple. We, uh, kill the Batman.

","Many viewers spotted a car in the background of the theatrical version when Sam says that he is now the furthest he has ever been from home. In a 1 December 2003 Newsweek article, director  Peter Jackson  confirmed this, and revealed the car had been removed digitally for the DVD release. Jackson says: 'We actually didn't know about the car until we were cutting the movie. The smoke and dust wasn't so bad because there was already lots of it around, but the bloody windshield was reflecting the sun back into the camera lens. So we erased it for the DVD. I think some people were upset because they
tried to show it to their friends and it was gone.' (The infamous car can be seen on the 'Academy DVD' which was created for the Oscar jurors and leaked on the Internet. Also, the unaltered shot with the car appearing in it is contained in the bonus material of the SEE DVD - the feature about the film score.) ","  Frodo  : I wish the ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened.    Gandalf  : So do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. There are other forces at work in this world Frodo, besides the will of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the Ring. In which case, you were also meant to have it. And that is an encouraging thought.  ","After the end credits, the DVD and Blu Ray editions of the extended cut feature a list of 'Lord of the Rings fan-club members' who contributed financially to the project in exchange for a credit. This additional credit sequence lasts 20 minutes. ","In March 2002 a 3-minute preview of the sequel, The Two Towers, was added to the theatrical release right before the end credits, making the film's running time 181m.

According to  Tom Hanks  he said, 'Sometimes when people go to Vietnam, they go home to their mommas without any legs. Sometimes they don't go home at all. That's a bad thing. That's all I have to say about that.' ","When Forrest is given his discharge papers, he sets down his ping-pong paddle and (computerized) ball to salute the officer. When he picks the paddle back up, he also pretends to pick up the ball, which didn't end up getting animated. ","  Forrest Gump  :  [running]  I had run for 3 years, 2 months, 14 days, and 16 hours.    [he stops and turns around]     Young Man Running  : Quiet, quiet! He's gonna say something!
