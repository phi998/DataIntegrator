    "The main aim is to measure the performance of activities that are delegated to external services, like ChatGpt or other LLMs. Data quality measurements for classic tasks like dropping html tags and semi-empty columns are ignored since the moment we trust the tools python gives us.\n",

    "Independently from the tasks we want to perform, we measure the similarity between two tables: the input and what we expect."

    "Furthermore, the user is asked to give some inputs, like the ontology, the importance of each item of the ontology and the type (title, prose, numeric)."
